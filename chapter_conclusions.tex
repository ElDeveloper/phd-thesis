Much like our microbial symbionts depend on the host environment (and vice
versa), the development and funding of analytical tools depends on the
ever-growing necessity to unravel complex patterns in a number of experimental
setups (cross-sectional, longitudinal, multi-'omic, etc). Thus these tools,
must take into consideration the ability to be flexible, scalable and when
possible interactive. The following is a brief justification of why these are
important factors:

Customization is always possible, but interactivity fosters creativity and
leads people to ask more questions.

Although most \glspl{fmt} succeed at treating \gls{cdi}, what makes a
successful transplant is not clear yet, the number of variables implicated in
answering this question is immense. From a computational complexity standpoint,
determining whether or not a new community can colonize an existing ecosystem
is considered a hard problem \cite{RN4266}. Therefore, we must continue to
expand our understanding, through the app
