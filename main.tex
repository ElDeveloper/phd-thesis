%   http://code.google.com/p/ucsd-thesis/wiki/GettingStarted



%% AMS PACKAGES - Chances are you will want some or all 
%    of these if writing a dissertation that includes equations.
%  \usepackage{amsmath, amscd, amssymb, amsthm}

%% GRAPHICX - This is the standard package for 
%    including graphics for latex/pdflatex.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% from fiverr
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{tabularx}
\usepackage{array}
\newcolumntype{P}[1]{>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{#1}}
\newcolumntype{M}{>{\centering\arraybackslash} m{2cm} }

\usepackage{rotating}
\usepackage{multirow}
\usepackage{textcomp}
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% from fiverr

%% SUBFIGURE - Use this to place multiple images in a
%    single figure.  Subfigure will handle placement and
%    proper captioning (e.g. Figure 1.2(a))
% \usepackage{subfigure}

%% LATIN MODERN FONTS (replacements for Computer Modern)
% \usepackage{lmodern}
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%% INDEX
%   Uncomment the following two lines to create an index: 
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex

% \index{keyword} 
%   within the text to create an entry in the index for keyword.

%% HYPERLINKS
%   To create a PDF with hyperlinks, you need to include the hyperref package.
%   THIS HAS TO BE THE LAST PACKAGE INCLUDED!
%   Note that the options plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels exist
%   to fix indexing associated with having both (ii) and (2) as pages.
%   Also, all links must be black according to OGS.
%   See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyperdupdest
%   Note: This may not work correctly with all DVI viewers (i.e. Yap breaks).
%   NOTE: hyperref will NOT work in draft mode, as noted above.
